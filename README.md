# Neural-Net
Neural Networks from scratch

The NNs are trained on the Boston Housing Dataset, taken from tensorflow datasets.
tensorflow was used exclusively for data collection and not for building the NNs in any way.
There are 2 versions of the code, one using numpy, and the other without using numpy.
Using numpy for matrix operations greatly improves the efficiency of the NNs, as is apparent after running the 2 versions.
For the same architecture and parameters, using numpy multiplies the speed of operations for NNs by over 3.

These NNs were built as a proof of concept and not with the focus on functionality.
